- in hash.c, some size_t -> uint64_t? for a 64-bit hash code?

- min_run_string, thresh.. = clean up sim.[ch]

- get rid of the nl_buff mechanism (2012!)

- report runs as '... matching text only ...' (proper name for Retrieve_Runs())

? plug memory leaks (and still report memory usage with -M!)

- unify idf2token() in *lang.l

- db_ not protected by #ifdef but by compilation to void ????

Done ================================================================

+ register - removed

+ Run hashing OK: average chain length = 1.5, for sim-ing the sources of MCD2
+ Idf hashing OK: smooth distribution when sim-ing the sources of MCD2

+ use two-byte tokens to obtain better resolution for sim_text and on -F option
  and UTF-8 (Johnson, Benjamin (US - Chicago))

+ different defaults per program

+ cleaning up sim.c & names

+ Microsoft comment (// ... unescaped \n)

+ emails 2009-2011 (A = I answered, R= they replied)
+AR	Marcus Brinkmann, separate letters
+AR	Scott Kuhl, percentages
+AR	Yaroslav Halchenko, identifying non-existent lines
+A	Rumen Stefanov, UTF-8
+A	Jonathan Martin, UTF-8
+AR	UTF-8 (Johnson, Benjamin (US - Chicago))

+ better structure between X.h and X.c

+ clean-up language.h and its sub-class algollike.h

+ warning in README to correct for non-MSDOS

Rejected ================================================================
