常见编译问题\r\n\r\n有的时候你的程序在本地能编译通过，但提交OJ后却显示编译错误。\r\n\r\n这多见于C/C++，一般是因为你本地用的是VS，VS的编译器是MS-VC++，而OJ用的是G++，这两个编译器的标准略有不同，G++更符合标准，下面列出一些常见的导致CE原因：\r\n\r\n* `main` 函数必须返回`int`, ` void main()` 的函数声明会报编译错误。\r\n* `itoa` 不是ansi标准函数.\r\n* `__int64` 不是ANSI标准定义，只能在VC使用, 但是可以使用`long long`声明64位整数。\r\n\r\n如果你使用JAVA语言，请注意类名一定要是`Main`， 否则也会返回CE。\r\n\r\n## 比赛相关\r\n\r\n### 比赛的类型\r\n\r\n目前HZNUOJ有四种类型的比赛：\r\n\r\n* practice，练习赛，只是简单的把题目归个类做做练习，相应题目不会从problemset中隐藏，且通过后可以立即进入题目的status里查看别人的代码。\r\n* public，公开的比赛，任何人均可进入参加。\r\n* password，设有密码保护的比赛，只有输入正确密码才能进入。\r\n* special，特殊比赛，只有使用专门发放的账号才能进入。\r\n\r\n### 比赛赛制\r\n\r\nHZNUOJ所有类型的比赛均为ACM/ICPC赛制。\r\n\r\n每场比赛设有若干道题目，比赛开始后，参赛者需在时限内去解决这些题目。\r\n\r\n每场比赛都设有实时榜单，榜单排名规则也与ACM/ICPC相同。\r\n\r\n### ACM/ICPC排名规则\r\n\r\n每题耗时：Accepted的那一刻距离比赛开始的时间。\r\n\r\n总罚时：所有AC了的题的（耗时+错误次数*20min）的和。\r\n\r\n排名时，AC题数优先，题数相同时按罚时排序。 \r\n\r\n有些比较正式的比赛设有封榜机制，即比赛最后一段时间内的提交结果将隐藏（除了自己都不可见），榜单也会停止更新，新的提交会显示为灰色，留作最后滚榜用。\r\n\r\n#### 滚榜机制介绍\r\n\r\n滚榜是ACM/ICPC系列比赛中一个十分具有特色的机制。\r\n\r\n在正规ACM/ICPC系列比赛中，比赛最后一个小时的提交结果是隐藏的，只有选手本人能看到，在榜单上会显示成代表未知的灰色，以增加比赛紧张气氛。\r\n\r\n然后在颁奖会上，将从榜单最后一名开始，一个个揭晓灰色的未知提交，一旦揭晓的结果为通过，这个人的排名就会上升，否则这个人的排名确定，开始揭晓下一个人，以此类推。这样一来，可以从后往前一个个确定最终排名，一旦名次达到获奖名次内，可以直接进行颁奖。整个过程惊险刺激，是整个比赛的亮点所在。\r\n\r\n## 题目相关\r\n\r\nHZNUOJ的所有题目均在ProblemSet 中，每个题目都有一个唯一的数字编号，称为Problem ID。\r\n\r\n每当你AC了一道题，你就有权限查看这题所有的提交代码，借鉴参考大神们的写法，从而更上一层楼。\r\n\r\n比赛的所有题目，都是从ProblemSet中选出来的，是它的子集。\r\n\r\n当一道题被选入某个非practice模式的比赛中之后，为公平起见，它会在ProblemSet中被隐藏掉，在比赛结束后恢复。\r\n\r\n一般如果题目突然不见了，可能就是这个原因，当然也有可能是因为其他原因而被管理员手动隐藏了。\r\n\r\n当然，一般比赛的题都是新出的，比赛结束后才第一次在ProblemSet中露面。\r\n\r\n选入比赛中的题目，在比赛界面中，会隐藏掉原来的Problem ID，取而代之的是A, B, C...的代号。在比赛结束后，会在标题旁边显示真正的Problem ID，可以点击前往ProblemSet补题。\r\n\r\n## 积分规则\r\n\r\nHZNUOJ的ProblemSet中设有一个榜单，积分和等级的计算规则如下。\r\n\r\n等级由实力（Strength）决定，当实力达到一定值后自然会升级，而实力又从刷题中来，每道题后面均标有分数（Scores），代表AC这道题之后能提升多少实力。一般来说，越少人做的题目，分数越高，一起刷题的人越多，每道题的分数也越高。需要说明的是，用户的实力值是会根据大环境动态变化的（其实是因为分数在动态变化），如果你AC的题目被更多人AC出来了，你的实力值会下降，另外一方面，OJ内有更多强者涌入的时候，你的实力值也会提升。所以，想要快速升级，那就多刷题，刷难题！\r\n\r\n等级划分与小说《斗破苍穹》一致，自低向高分别为斗之气、斗者、斗师、大斗师、斗灵、斗王、斗皇、斗宗、斗尊、斗圣、斗帝，除斗帝外，每一阶又分不同等级，阶数越高，升级越困难。除此之外，每一阶还有不同的代表颜色，该阶等级越高，颜色越深。\r\n\r\n');

Computer chess has come a long way since then, and in 1997 IBM\'s Deep Blue defeated chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov. One thing all these chess programs have in common though is a need to determine when the winning move, or <i>checkmate</i>, is reached. Your goal for this problem is to implement an algorithm such that, given the current layout of the chessboard, it will detect if a checkmate has occurred during that turn.</p>\n<p>Chess is played on a board divided into a 8x8 grid of 64 squares. On a real chessboard, the 64 squares have alternating light and dark colors. For this problem the individual square colors are irrelevant and the entire board is simply treated as a uniform 8x8 grid.</p>\n<p>The game is played by two opposing sides, white and black, with each side controlling up to six kinds of pieces: a <i>king</i>, <i>queen</i>, <i>rook</i>, <i>bishop</i>, <i>knight</i>, and one or more <i>pawn</i>s.

It is up to each player to decide which piece they wish to move on their turn, but it is not possible for a player to &quot;skip&quot; or &quot;pass&quot;; each player <b>must</b> move one of their pieces in some fashion.</p>\n<p>Each kind of chess piece moves in a distinct way as explained in the list below, and <i>Figure 1</i> gives an example using an X to show each square that a chess piece can move to.</p>\n<ul class=\"example\">\n    <li><i>Rook</i>: The rook moves in a straight line by any number of squares in any of the four cardinal (horizontal and vertical) directions.</li>\n    <li><i>Bishop</i>: The bishop moves in a line by any number of squares in any of the four diagonal directions.</li>\n    <li><i>Queen</i>: The queen can move in a line by any number of squares in any of the eight cardinal and diagonal directions. As such, it is considered to be the most powerful piece in the game.</li>\n    <li><i>Knight</i>: The knight always moves by &quot;jumping&quot; two squares in one cardinal direction and one square in a direction perpendicular to the first. There are 8 possible squares that a knight can move to from a given position, and these are shown in the figure below.</li>\n    <li><i>King</i>: The king can move in any of the eight cardinal and diagonal directions but by one square only. Put another way, the king can only move into the eight immediately adjacent squares. As such, this makes the king one of the weakest pieces on the board.</li>\n</ul>\n<table border=\"0\" align=\"center\" class=\"example\">\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td><img src=\"/JudgeOnline/admin/../upload/pimg1044_1.png\" alt=\"\" /> <br />\n            <i>Rook</i></td>\n            <td><img src=\"/JudgeOnline/admin/../upload/pimg1044_2.png\" alt=\"\" /> <br />\n            <i>Bishop</i></td>\n            <td><img src=\"/JudgeOnline/admin/../upload/pimg1044_3.png\" alt=\"\" /> <br />\n            <i>Queen</i></td>\n            <td><img src=\"/JudgeOnline/admin/../upload/pimg1044_4.png\" alt=\"\" /> <br />\n            <i>Knight</i></td>\n            <td><img src=\"/JudgeOnline/admin/../upload/pimg1044_5.png\" alt=\"\" /> <br />\n            <i>King</i></td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n    <caption> <b>Figure 1:</b> Valid moves for each kind of chess piece </caption>\n</table>\n<p>On every turn, a chess piece may be moved either into a vacant square or into a square already occupied by an opposing piece. In the latter case, the opposing chess piece is said to be</p>\n<i>captured</i>\n<p>and is permanently removed from the game. However, a chess piece</p>\n<b>may not</b>\n<p>move into a square already occupied by another friendly piece, because each square can be occupied by at most one piece at a time. Most chess pieces move by &quot;sliding&quot; across vacant squares on the board. In other words, any other chess piece (be it friendly or foe) in the path of the moving piece will block any further movement of that piece. The only exception to this rule is the knight which &quot;jumps&quot; directly to its final destination square, and therefore its movement cannot be blocked  by any surrounding pieces between it and the destination square. See</p>\n<i>Figure 2</i>\n<p>for an example: image (a) shows a white rook\'s movement blocked by two other pieces, and image (b) shows the same white rook capturing a black bishop (the rook\'s previous position before the capture is shown as a white outline).</p>\n<p>\n<table border=\"0\" align=\"center\" class=\"example\">\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td><img src=\"/JudgeOnline/admin/../upload/pimg1044_6.png\" alt=\"\" /> <br />\n            <i>(a)</i></td>\n            <td><img src=\"/JudgeOnline/admin/../upload/pimg1044_7.png\" alt=\"\" /> <br />\n            <i>(b)</i></td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n    <caption> <b>Figure 2:</b> (a) rook\'s movement blocked by other pieces; (b) rook capturing the black bishop </caption>\n</table>\nAlthough the king may be one of the weakest pieces on the board, it is also the most important. A king cannot be captured directly by another piece but it can be threatened. When the king is threatened, or <i>checked</i>, it means that on the <b>next</b> turn, the opposing side would be able to capture the king. Putting a king in check forces the checked side to defend their king by moving the king out of harm\'s way, blocking the threat with another piece, or capturing the threatening piece. If the checked player has no valid move that they can make to protect the king, then the king is in fact <i>checkmated</i>, and that player has lost the game. Also note that a player may never put their own king in check. <i>Figure 3</i> shows the difference between a check and checkmate. In image (a), the imminent capture of the white king can still be avoided by either moving the king out of the way or by capturing the black queen. Image (b) shows an example of checkmate, where no valid moves exist for the white side that would eliminate the threat to the king.</p>\n<p>\n<table border=\"0\" align=\"center\" class=\"example\">\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td><img src=\"/JudgeOnline/admin/../upload/pimg1044_8.png\" alt=\"\" /> <br />\n            <i>Check</i></td>\n            <td><img src=\"/JudgeOnline/admin/../upload/pimg1044_9.png\" alt=\"\" /> <br />\n            <i>Checkmate</i></td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n    <caption> <b>Figure 3:</b> Example of white king in (a) check and (b) checkmate </caption>\n</table>\nThe rules laid out above are the only ones that should be considered for the purposes of this problem.

	(1052,'The Extent of the Problem','<p>Files on modern filesystems are not always stored contiguously.  Instead, they are broken up into chunks (called</p>\n<p><i>extents</i></p>\n<p>), each of which may be located almost anywhere on the underlying disk.  Each extent takes up one or more contiguous</p>\n<p><i>blocks</i></p>\n<p>on the disk, which represent the underlying physical disk structure.  Files may not share blocks or extents between themselves, although there may be (and hopefully are) blocks not currently in use on the filesystem.</p>\n<p>Despite all of the advances in modern disk technology, this disparate layout still makes for slower access than when all of a file\'s blocks are in order and adjacent (and therefore occupying a single extent). Because of this, many modern filesystems support <i>defragmentation</i>: the reorganizing of files on the disk so that the blocks of any given file are in order and adjacent.</p>\n<p>With RAD\'s Awesome Dynamic Filesystem (commonly referred to as <b>RADfs</b>), a file can occupy any number of extents, each of which consists of at least two adjacent blocks.  The first block in an extent holds metadata about that extent; the rest contain some portion of the file.  Consider this simple representation of the extents and blocks occupied by a file:</p>\n<p></p>\n<pre>\nRADfs.doc: 57-58,102-114,23-47</pre>\n<p>The file <tt>RADfs.doc</tt> currently occupies 40 blocks on the disk, even though the file itself is only 37 blocks in size.  The smallest on-disk size that it could have is 38 blocks (37 plus a single metadata block), and that can only happen if the entire file is in a single extent.  One potential single-extent representation of the file is:</p>\n<p></p>\n<pre>\nRADfs.doc: 115-152</pre>\n<p>Here, the single metadata block (115) is followed by the 37 data blocks in a single extent.</p>\n<p>The developers of RADfs have also developed the RADical Defragmentation Daemon, or RADDD.  RADDD works with a simple two-step algorithm; despite its simplicity, it still manages to significantly reduce the number of extents consumed by files, given enough free space on the disk.</p>\n<p>A RADDD pass works as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>First Step (&quot;to the back&quot;):\n    <ul>\n        <li>For every file on the filesystem that hasn\'t been run through this           step on this pass, sorted in <b>ascending</b> order by the           <b>first</b> block it occupies on the disk:\n        <ul>\n            <li>Find the series of adjacent unused blocks nearest the               <b>end</b> of the disk that can hold the file plus a single               metadata block</li>\n            <li>If such a series exists:\n            <ul>\n                <li>Move the file to those blocks</li>\n                <li>Mark the original blocks as unused</li>\n            </ul>\n            </li>\n            <li>Else do nothing to the file</li>\n        </ul>\n        </li>\n    </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>Second Step (&quot;to the front&quot;):\n    <ul>\n        <li>For every file on the filesystem that hasn\'t been run through this           step on this pass, sorted in <b>descending</b> order by the           <b>last</b> block it occupies on the disk:\n        <ul>\n            <li>Find the series of adjacent unused blocks nearest the               <b>beginning</b> of the disk that can hold the file plus a               single metadata block</li>\n            <li>If such a series exists:\n            <ul>\n                <li>Move the file to those blocks</li>\n                <li>Mark the original blocks as unused</li>\n            </ul>\n            </li>\n            <li>Else do nothing to the file</li>\n        </ul>\n        </li>\n    </ul>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>After one pass on a filesystem with some free space, some files have hopefully been reduced to a single extent.

	(1053,'Filtration','<p>Digital Signal Processing is used for such clever effects as the &quot;echo&quot; often heard in music, or that annoying modulation done with the voices of certain singers.

Time travel can only be done by moving through wormholes that connect two specific instances of time together. As a result, an agent must travel through several wormholes in sequence to reach his or her destination time. In addition, an agent may have to spend some time living in the past or future while waiting for the next wormhole to appear. Traveling through a wormhole also isn\'t as simple as it might seem: moving forward in time through a wormhole will instanteously age the user by a certain number of years and moving backwards through one will instanteously make the traveller slightly younger.</p>\n<p>Because the agency pays its agents based on how many years they\'ve aged since joining the service, you are required to minimize the &quot;aging process&quot; as much as possible for every agent.

You\'ve been asked to replace Kyle (who quit the devteam) and help with fixing some of the bugs.</p>\n<p>The main problem with the current release of <tt>td</tt>, as it is commonly referred to, is that it cannot differentiate between text on a line and commands.  Whenever a user wants to type an <tt>x</tt>, the editor interprets it as a command to delete the last character.  This is problematic.  Thankfully, commands are case-sensitive, and each letter is at most a single command (sometimes uppercase, sometimes lowercase), so one can manage to write any given line of text as long as it\'s allowed to look like something written by a fourteen-year-old hacker wannabe.</p>\n<p>Editing occurs in an <i>edit buffer</i>, which starts out empty. The cursor in <tt>td</tt> rests in <i>gaps</i>, locations surrounding each printed character.  When a non-command character is entered, the character is inserted to the right of the cursor\'s current location and the cursor moves to the gap to the right of the new character.  (This is the standard behavior of most editors.)  A line with no characters has a single gap. A line with a single printable character has two (one before and one after), a line with two printable characters has three, and so on.</p>\n<p>The currently-implemented commands are:\n<table border=\"1\" align=\"center\">\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Command keys</td>\n            <td>Result</td>\n            <td>Cursor location after operation</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><tt>x</tt></td>\n            <td>Delete the character immediately to the left of the cursor</td>\n            <td>One gap to the left</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><tt>K</tt></td>\n            <td>Delete all non-spaces to the left of the cursor, stopping at the           first space encountered or the beginning of the line; if the           previous character is a space, delete nothing</td>\n            <td>The gap to the right of the &quot;stop&quot; character</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><tt>c</tt></td>\n            <td>Duplicate the character to the left of the cursor, inserting it to           the right of the cursor</td>\n            <td>The gap to the right of the duplicate character (one right)</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><tt>D</tt></td>\n            <td>Duplicate all non-spaces to the left of the cursor, stopping at the           first space encountered or the beginning of the line and inserting           them to the right of the cursor; if the previous character is a           space, duplicate nothing</td>\n            <td>The gap to the right of the rightmost duplicate character</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><tt>R</tt></td>\n            <td>Reverse all non-spaces to the left of the cursor, stopping at the           first space encountered or the beginning of the line; if the           previous character is a space, reverse nothing</td>\n            <td>No change</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><tt>p</tt></td>\n            <td>Delete all characters to the left of the cursor</td>\n            <td>Leftmost gap</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><tt>W</tt></td>\n            <td>Delete all characters to the right of the cursor</td>\n            <td>No change</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><tt>h</tt></td>\n            <td>Move the cursor one gap to the left</td>\n            <td>One gap to the left</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><tt>L</tt></td>\n            <td>Move the cursor one gap to the right</td>\n            <td>One gap to the right</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><tt>f</tt></td>\n            <td>Move the cursor to the first gap on the line</td>\n            <td>Leftmost gap</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><tt>G</tt></td>\n            <td>Move the cursor to the last gap on the line</td>\n            <td>Rightmost gap</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><i>any non-command character</i></td>\n            <td>Insert the character into the edit buffer to the right of the cursor</td>\n            <td>One gap to the right</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\nFor the purposes of this problem, the only characters are uppercase and lowercase characters, digits, and spaces.</p>\n<p>When a character is added internally to a line of text, all subsequent characters shift to the right (as in &quot;insert mode&quot;); when characters are deleted from anywhere other than the end of a line, all subsequent characters shift to the left.</p>\n<p>Any commands which cannot properly do anything (attempting to move past the first or last gap, deleting characters when none exist, and so on) do nothing.

A star (*) means zero or more repetitions of the preceding item; likewise, a plus (+) means one or more repetitions, and a phrase enclosed in square brackets ([ ]) means zero or one occurrences (in other words, the enclosed phrase is optional). The * and + operators bind as tightly as possible; parentheses are used for grouping. Literal strings are enclosed in quotes. White space is only meaningful to separate tokens.

	(1134,'Pseudo-random Numbers','Access to high-quality randomness is very important for many applications, especially in cryptography. Radioactive decay is somtimes used as a source of \"true randomness\", but this is a fairly slow procedure for getting random numbers. Also, in many applications it is important that the same “random” sequence can be produced in two different places. For these reasons one often uses a pseudo-random sequence instead. A pseudo-random sequence is a sequence that is, in fact, not random, but very hard to distinguish from a truly random sequence. A pseudo-random sequence should also be difficult to predict, i.e., given the first few elements of the sequence it should be difficult do determine some later, yet unseen, number in the sequence. \nThe Association of Cryptographic Machinery (ACM) has devised an algorithm for generating pseudo-random number sequences, but they have no idea how good it really is. Therefore they want you to test it. \nThe algorithm to generate a sequence of integers, where each integer is between 0 and B - 1 inclusive, is as follows: \n<ol>\n<li type=\"1\">Start with any number (the seed) in base B. This number can contain hundreds of base B digits. \n<li type=\"1\">The last digit (least significant) is output as the next element of the sequence. \n<li type=\"1\">Create a new number by writing down the sum of all neighbouring digits from left to right. E.g., with B = 10, the number 845 would yield the number 129 (since 8 + 4 = 12 and 4 + 5 = 9). \n<li type=\"1\">Repeat steps 2 and 3 as many times as needed, or until the number has only one base B digit. You get one more pseudo-random digit between 0 and B - 1 each time. \n</ol>\nIf we have B = 10 and the seed number is 845, then the next numbers will be 129, 311 (1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 9 = 11), 42 (3 + 1 = 4, 1 + 1 = 2), and 6 (4 + 2 = 6). As 6 is a single digit base 10 number, the algorithm terminates. The pseudo-random digits generated are 5, 9, 1, 2 and 6. \nYou will be testing the generator as follows. You will be given the first L elements output by the generator and an integer T > L. You are supposed to decide if the first T elements are completely determined by the first L elements. To check the robustness of your testing procedure the ACM have slipped in some impossible sequences, i.e. sequences that cannot be generated by any initial seed.','On the first line of the input is a single positive integer N, telling the number of test cases to follow.

The declaration of content lists the ingredients of the product. It does not necessarily tell you the exact amount of every ingredient, only the ordering of the ingredients, from most common to least common. For some ingredients, an exact percentage might be given, either required by law or because the producer wants you to know how much of the fine expensive ingredients they have used. Given a set of different products and their respective declarations of content you should determine which contain the most or the least of some given ingredients. For simplicity, we assume in this problem that the percentage of each ingredient always is an integer. \n</img>','The input consists of several test cases. Each test case consists of two parts. \n\nThe first part of a test case begins with an integer P, 1 ≤ P ≤ 10, the number of different products in this test case, on a line of its own.

Each product description consists of a line giving the name of the product, followed by a line containing an integer n, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, giving the number of ingredients in this product. Then follow n lines, the i:th of which contains the name of the i:th most common ingredient of the product. In case of ties, the ingredients will be listed in arbitrary order. Optionally, every ingredient name can be followed by space, an integer p, 0 ≤ p ≤ 100 and a percentage sign. If this is present, it specifies the exact amount of this ingredient in the product. Otherwise, because all percentages in this problem are integers, the ingredient makes up at least one percent of the total product. \n\nThe second part of a test case begins with an integer Q, 1 ≤ Q ≤ 100, the number of queries. Then follow Q lines, each containing a query. A query is of the form \"least X\", or \"most X\", where X is the name of an ingredient. In the \"most X\" case, the ingredient X is guaranteed to be present in at least one of the products. \n\nA name of a product or an ingredient is a string of alphabetic characters (A-Z and a-z), digits (0-9) and underscore.

Escaping, Jospehus found himself trapped in a cave with 40 companions.  The  Romans discovered his whereabouts and invited him to surrender, but his  companions refused to allow him to do so.  He therefore suggested that they  kill each other, one by one, the order to be decided by lot.  Tradition has it  that the means for effecting the lot was to stand in a circle, and, beginning  at some point, count round, every third person being killed in turn.  The  sole survivor of this process was Josephus, who then surrendered to the  Romans.

We then proceed to count a further <i>k</i> people in a  clockwise direction, starting with the person immediately to the left of the  victim.  The person number <i>k</i> so selected has the job of burying the  victim, and then returning to the position in the circle that the victim had  previously occupied.  Counting then proceeeds from the person to his  immediate left, with the <i>k</i>th person being killed, and so on, until only one  person remains.</p>\r\n<p>For example, when <i>n</i> = 5, and <i>k</i> = 2, and <i>i</i> = 1, the order of execution is  2, 5, 3, and 1.

There are no restrictions on turns for other roads.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>This system allows a very simple method of determining one\'s current position and a way of arriving at one\'s destination. Position can be specified in terms of the last intersection you passed through (the numbers of the Avenue and Street that meet there) and your current heading, which can be one of: north (N), northeast (NE), east (E), southeast (SE), south (S), southwest (SW), west (W) and northwest (NW). Directions can then be given in terms of how many intersections to pass through and which turns to make. However, the locals have an infuriating habit of giving incorrect or invalid directions, although it cannot be determined whether this is deliberate or accidental. Directions should (but don\'t always) conform to the following simple grammar:</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<blockquote> &lt;command&gt; ::= &lt;turn_command&gt;  <img align=\"MIDDLE\" width=\"2\" height=\"27\" src=\"/JudgeOnline/admin/../upload/pimg1183_2.gif\" alt=\"tex2html_wrap_inline231\" />  &lt;straight_command&gt; <br />\r\n&lt;turn_command&gt; ::= TURN [HALF  <img align=\"MIDDLE\" width=\"2\" height=\"27\" src=\"/JudgeOnline/admin/../upload/pimg1183_2.gif\" alt=\"tex2html_wrap_inline231\" />  SHARP] {LEFT  <img align=\"MIDDLE\" width=\"2\" height=\"27\" src=\"/JudgeOnline/admin/../upload/pimg1183_2.gif\" alt=\"tex2html_wrap_inline231\" />  RIGHT} <br />\r\n&lt;straight_command&gt; ::= GO [STRAIGHT] n  <img align=\"MIDDLE\" width=\"11\" height=\"24\" src=\"/JudgeOnline/admin/../upload/pimg1183_3.gif\" alt=\"tex2html_wrap_inline249\" />  n  <img align=\"MIDDLE\" width=\"11\" height=\"24\" src=\"/JudgeOnline/admin/../upload/pimg1183_3.gif\" alt=\"tex2html_wrap_inline249\" />  99 </blockquote>\r\n<p>Write a program that will simulate driving through such a city, by tracking your position and heading as you follow a set of directions (commands).

	(1187,'Xenosemantics','<p>Contact with extra-terrestrial intelligence has been made at last!! A stream of messages has been discovered, apparently emanating from Procyon IV. After intensive study by the world\'s best xenosemanticists, the following definite conclusions on the format of the messages have been reached. The messages are streams of bits divided into groups of 8. Somewhat coincidentally the meaningful parts of the message map onto the lower case alphabet, although other characters sometimes intervene. Letters are organised into words separated by spacer letters. The spacer letter varies within a message, but a word which is delimited by a particular spacer pair does not contain that spacer letter within it. In addition the message is conceptually bounded by a pair of `joker\' letters or `wild spacers\' that can match any letter. For example, a message segment <tt> xwrxwtx</tt> contains 3 words--<tt>wr</tt>, <tt>wt</tt>, and <tt>rx</tt>; <tt>wrxwt</tt> is not a word in this segment of the message. If this segment appeared at the start of a message then <tt>xw</tt> and <tt>xwrxw</tt> could also be words. The words <tt>wr</tt> and <tt>rx</tt> overlap, while <tt>wt</tt> does not overlap any words in this message segment. While a word contains the same letters each time it appears in one message, the order of the letters may vary in different occurrences of the same word. Each message contains many words which are not ``true\'\' words in that they carry no meaning (like err.., umm.., etc in English). Every true word in the message contains at least two and no more than 250 letters, overlaps with another true word, and is repeated somewhere in the message (possibly with the letters in a different order). In the example above, <tt>wr</tt> and <tt>rx</tt> would both be true words if <tt> wr</tt> or <tt>rw</tt>, and <tt>rx</tt> or <tt>xr</tt>, occurred as words elsewhere in the message. The word <tt>wt</tt> would be a true word if <tt>wt</tt> or <tt>tw</tt> occurred elsewhere in the message, overlapping another true word.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Write a program that will read in messages and print out a list of the different true words contained in each message (using the spelling which occurs first), in the order the words first appear in the message.

In a very short time two programs emerge, Paskill and Lisper, which move through the network marking each node they visit: Paskill activates a modified Prolog interpreter and Lisper activates the `Hello World\' program. However `Hello World\' has mutated into an endless loop that so ties up the node that no other program, not even Lisper, can re-enter that node and the Prolog interpreter immediately reverse compiles (and destroys) any program that enters. However, Paskill knows which nodes it has visited and never tries to re-enter them. Thus if Lisper attempts to enter a node already visited by Paskill it will be annihilated; neither can enter a node already visited by Lisper, if either (or both) cannot move both will halt and if they ever arrive at a node simultaneously they annihilate each other. Both programs move through the network at the same speed.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Write a program to simulate these events.

	(1191,'Strategy','<p>A well known psychology experiment involves people playing a game in which they can either trade with each other or attempt to cheat the other player. If both players TRADE then each gains one point. If one TRADEs and the other CHEATs then the TRADEr loses 2 points and the CHEATer wins 2. If both CHEAT then each loses 1 point.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>There are a variety of different strategies for playing this game, although most people are either unable to find a winning strategy, or, having decided on a strategy, do not stick to it. Thus it is fairer to attempt to evaluate these strategies by simulation on a computer. Each strategy is simulated by an automaton. An automaton is characterised by a program incorporating the strategy, a memory for previous encounters and a count reflecting the score of that automaton. The count starts at zero and is altered according to the above rules after each encounter. The memory is able to determine what happened on up to the last two encounters with each other contender.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Write a program that will read in details of up to 10 different strategies, play each strategy against each other strategy 10 times and then print out the final scores.

However, it is possible to subscribe to various services which claim that they will find articles that fit an `interest profile\' that you supply, and pass them on to you. One simple way of performing such a search is to determine whether a pair of keywords occurs `sufficiently\' close to each other in the title of an article. The threshold is determined by the researchers themselves, and refers to the number of words that may occur between the pair of keywords. Thus an archeologist interested in cave paintings could specify her profile as ``<tt>0 rock art</tt>\'\', meaning that she wants all titles in which the words ``<tt>rock</tt>\'\' and ``<tt>art</tt>\'\' appear with 0 words in between, that is next to each other.

Their method of choosing a chief was the ``Eeny meeny miny mo\'\' method.

A higher card will beat a lower card in the same suit, but will not usually beat any other card in a different suit.

	(1196,'Bonus Bonds','<p>The government of Impecunia does not levy any taxes, instead it raises money by the (sometimes forced) sale of Bonus Bonds. Originally the Bonds were numbered using a 7 digit number prefixed by a one digit code in the range 1 to 9 representing the region of Impecunia in which the bond was sold. However the scheme has proved so popular that the numbering scheme has been extended by a further two digits. To retain compatibility with the previous scheme, the 8th digit from the right (the third from the left) still designates the region of sale. At the same time, a `central\' region was created and has been given the designation 0. For security reasons no bond may be numbered with a number consisting entirely of zeroes, thus, although the original bonds all started from zero (since the region code was non-zero), the bonds from the central region start from 0000000001.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Each month, the winning numbers are drawn for each region independently. The equipment generates a stream of single digits and it would appear to be simple enough to collect these together in groups of ten and compare the results with the list of Bond-holders. However, the equipment is a little antiquated and is liable to various breakdowns, thus it is desirable to only generate numbers that lie within the allocated range and with the same distributions of digits at each position as would be found by examining all the bonds sold for that region. Thus if we wish to draw <i>N</i> numbers for a given region, the equipment is set to generate 10 streams of <i>N</i> digits, one for each position. The first winning number is then made up by taking the first digit from each stream, the second winning number is composed of the second digit in each stream, and so on. For each stream, the equipment is adjusted so that the distribution of digits it generates closely matches the actual distributions of digits in that position on the allocated Bonds.

	(1198,'Roman Numerals','<p>The original system of writing numbers used by the early Romans was simple but cumbersome. Various letters were used to represent important numbers, and these were then strung together to represent other numbers with the values decreasing monotonically from left to right.

	(1200,'Synchronous Design','<p>The designers of digital integrated circuits (IC) are very concerned about the correctness of their designs because, unlike software, ICs cannot be easily tested. Real tests are not possible until the design has been finalized and the IC has been produced.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>To simulate the behavior of a digital IC and to more or less guarantee that the final chip will work, all of today\'s digital ICs are based on a <i>synchronous design</i>.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><a name=\"27\">&nbsp;</a> <img align=\"BOTTOM\" src=\"/JudgeOnline/admin/../upload/pimg1200_1.gif\" alt=\"figure22\" /> <br />\r\n<strong>Figure:</strong> The critical path (dashed line) takes 43ns to settle</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>In a synchronous design, an external clock signal triggers the IC to go from a well defined and stable state to the next one. On the active edge of the clock, all input and output signals and all internal nodes are stable in either the high or low state. Between two consecutive edges of the clock, the signals and nodes are allowed to change and may take any intermediate state. The behavior of a synchronous network is predictable and will not fail due to hazards or glitches introduced by irregularities of the real circuit.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>To analyze whether an IC has a synchronous design, we distinguish between <i>synchronous</i> and  <img align=\"MIDDLE\" width=\"157\" height=\"25\" src=\"/JudgeOnline/admin/../upload/pimg1200_2.gif\" alt=\"tex2html_wrap_inline65\" /> . Flip flops are synchronous nodes. On the active edge of the clock, the output of the flip flop changes to the state of the input and holds that state throughout the next clock cycle. Synchronous nodes are connected to the clock signal.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Simple gates like ANDs or ORs are asynchronous nodes. Their output changes - with a short delay - whenever one of their inputs changes. During that transition phase, the output can even go into some undefined or intermediate state.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>For simplicity, we assume that all inputs of the circuits are directly connected to the output of a synchronous node outside the circuit and that all outputs of the circuit are directly connected to the input of a synchronous node outside the circuit.</p>\r\n<p>For an IC to have a synchronous design, mainly two requirements must be met:</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>The  <img align=\"MIDDLE\" width=\"99\" height=\"25\" src=\"/JudgeOnline/admin/../upload/pimg1200_3.gif\" alt=\"tex2html_wrap_inline67\" />  introduced between two synchronous nodes must be smaller or equal than the clock period so there is enough time for nodes to become stable.

Instead of having names, the days of the months were denoted by numbers starting from 0 to 19. The last month of Haab was called <i>uayet</i> and had 5 days denoted by numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

They used 20 names: <i>imix, ik, akbal, kan, chicchan, cimi, manik, lamat, muluk, ok, chuen, eb, ben, ix, mem, cib, caban, eznab, canac, ahau</i> and 13 numbers; both in cycles.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Notice that each day has an unambiguous description.

Unfortunately, the material used to cover the floor is very sensitive to light. It turned out that its expected life time is decreasing dramatically. To avoid this, authorities have decided to protect light sensitive areas from strong light by covering them. The solution was not very easy because, as it is common, in the basement there are different pipelines under the ceiling and the authorities want to install the covers just on those parts of the floor that are not shielded from the light by pipes.

(The board in the above figure is still in the process of being covered.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The score of a board is calculated as the sum of all 15 row scores (5 rows for each primary direction).

Otherwise (the pieces carry different numbers in the row direction) the row score is zero. Note that the pieces may not be rotated.

Using millions of dominoes of different colors and materials to fill whole halls with elaborate patterns of falling dominoes, they created (short-lived) pieces of art.

As you can imagine, timing is an essential factor here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It is now your task to write a program that, given such a system of rows formed by dominoes, computes when and where the last domino falls. The system consists of several ``key dominoes\' connected by rows of simple dominoes. When a key domino falls, all rows connected to the domino will also start falling (except for the ones that have already fallen). When the falling rows reach other key dominoes that have not fallen yet, these other key dominoes will fall as well and set off the rows connected to them. Domino rows may start collapsing at either end. It is even possible that a row is collapsing on both ends, in which case the last domino falling in that row is somewhere between its key dominoes.

However, since any rearrangement suffices, box D can be contorted, not just turned (see examples below).</p>\r\n<p>For example, the box D = (2,6) nests in the box E = (7,3) since D can be rearranged as (6,2) so that each dimension is less than the corresponding dimension in E.

	(1228,'Arbitrage','<p>The use of computers in the finance industry has been marked with controversy lately as programmed trading -- designed to take advantage of extremely small fluctuations in prices -- has been outlawed at many Wall Street firms.  The ethics of computer programming is a fledgling field with many thorny issues.</p>\r\n<p><em>Arbitrage</em> is the trading of one currency for another with the hopes of taking advantage of small differences in conversion rates among several currencies in order to achieve a profit.   For example, if $1.00 in U.S. currency buys 0.7 British pounds currency, &pound;1 in British currency buys 9.5 French francs, and 1 French franc buys 0.16 in U.S. dollars, then an arbitrage trader can start with $1.00 and earn  <img width=\"209\" height=\"24\" alt=\"tex2html_wrap_inline29\" src=\"/OJ/admin/../upload/pimg1228_1.gif\" />  dollars thus earning a profit of 6.4 percent.</p>\r\n<p>You will write a program that determines whether a sequence of currency exchanges can yield a profit as described above.</p>\r\n<p>To result in successful arbitrage, a sequence of exchanges must begin and end with the same currency, but any starting currency may be considered.</p>','<p>The input file consists of one or more conversion tables.

The maximum dimension is 20; the minimum dimension is 2.</p>\r\n<p>The table then follows in row major order but with the diagonal elements of the table missing (these are assumed to have value 1.0). Thus the first row of the table represents the conversion rates between country 1 and <i>n</i>-1 other countries, i.e., the amount of currency of country <i>i</i> ( <img width=\"70\" height=\"25\" alt=\"tex2html_wrap_inline37\" src=\"/JudgeOnline/admin/../upload/pimg1228_2.gif\" /> ) that can be purchased with one unit of the currency of country 1.</p>\r\n<p>Thus each table consists of <i>n</i>+1 lines in the input file: 1 line containing <i>n</i> and <i>n</i> lines representing the conversion table.</p>','<p>For each table in the input file you must determine whether a sequence of exchanges exists that results in a profit of more than  1 percent (0.01).  If a sequence exists you must print the sequence of exchanges that results in a profit.  If there is more than one sequence that results in a profit of more than 1 percent you must print a  sequence of minimal length, i.e., one of the sequences that uses the fewest exchanges of currencies to yield a profit.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Because the IRS (United States Internal Revenue Service) notices lengthy transaction sequences, all profiting sequences must consist of <i>n</i> or fewer transactions where <i>n</i> is the dimension of the table giving conversion rates.

This twisting is called torque and is equal to the object\'s weight multiplied by its distance from the fulcrum (the angle of the lever also comes in, but that does not concern us here). If the object is to the left of the fulcrum, the direction of the torque is counterclockwise; if the object is to the right, the direction is clockwise. To compute the torque around a support, simply sum all the torques of the individual objects on the lever.</p>\r\n<p>The challenge is to keep the lever balanced while adjusting the objects on it. Assume you have a straight, evenly weighted board, 20 meters long and weighing three kilograms. The middle of the board is the center of mass, and we will call that position 0. So the possible positions on the board range from -10 (the left end) to +10 (the right end). The board is supported at positions -1.5 and +1.5 by two equal fulcrums, both two meters tall and standing on a flat floor. On the board are six packages, at positions -8, -4, -3, 2, 5 and 8, having weights of 4, 10, 10, 4, 7 and 8 kilograms, respectively as in the picture below.</p>\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img align=\"center\" alt=\"\" src=\"/JudgeOnline/admin/../upload/pimg1253_1.gif\" /></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n</center>\r\n<p>Your job is to remove the packages one at a time in such a way that the board rests on both supports without tipping. The board would tip if the net torque around the left fulcrum (resulting from the weights of the packages and the board itself) were counterclockwise or if the net torque around the right fulcrum were clockwise.  A possible solution to this problem is: first remove the package at position -4, then the package at 8, then -8, then 5, then -3 and finally 2.</p>\r\n<p>You are to write a program which solves problems like the one described above.  The input contains multiple cases.  Each case starts with three integers: the length of the board (in meters, at least 3), the weight of the board (in kilograms) and <em>n</em> the number of packages on the board (<em>n</em> &lt;= 20). The board is supported at positions -1.5 and +1.5 by two equal fulcrums, both two meters tall and standing on a flat floor. The following <em>n</em> lines contain two integers each: the position of a package on board (in meters measured from the center, negative means to the left) and the weight of the package (in kilograms).  A line containing three 0\'s ends the input.

You can get pretty much anywhere in Europe on a train, including little towns.  In Canada, train service is not quite as good.  Sometimes you have to change trains many times, and it\'s often hard to know the quickest route and where to switch. Depending on the time of day, the route may even pass through completely different cities. Fortunately, you can write a program to help you.  Given the schedules of trains running between different places, your task is to find all the shortest connections between two places. A shortest connection is one for which there is no other connection that would allow you to leave later and arrive at the same time or earlier, or leave at the same time and arrive earlier. Time to change trains need not be considered, as it is already built into the schedule.</p>\r\n<p>The first line of input contains a positive integer N, the number of test cases.  The first line of each test case contains T &lt;= 20, the number of train routes.  Each train route is described by one or more lines containing:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>S &lt;= 20  The number of stations on the route including origin and terminus.</li>\r\n    <li>hh:mm  The starting time of the route (in 24-hour clock notation; that is, in the range 00:00 to 23:59).  You may assume that a train leaves the origin every day at this time.  A station name is a string of no more than 40 alphabetic characters.</li>\r\n    <li>A list of the names of the S stations, separated by the travel time between adjacent stations.  Travel time is given in hours and minutes.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Finally, each test case gives the name of an origin and destination for which a schedule is to be generated.  You may assume there is at least one route from the specified origin to the specified destination.  The output consists of a list of shortest connection departure and travel times from the origin to the destination, ordered by departure time. Each combination of departure and travel time should be listed only once, even if there are multiple routings yielding the same connection times. The departure time should be given as hh:mm (that is, exactly 2 digits each).  Travel time on the other hand should be given as h:mm, hh:mm, hhh:mm, etc., as appropriate to avoid unnecessary leading 0\'s.  Leave an empty line between the output for successive test cases.</p>\r\n<p>For example, the first route in the sample input begins in Windsor at 08:00 a.m., arrives in London at 09:55, in Kitchener at 11:30, Guelph at 12:25, Toronto at 13:30 and Montreal at 18:20. To get from Waterloo to Toronto we can leave at 07:00 and travel direct for a total time of 1:45.  Or we can leave at 08:00 and travel to Kitchener, then to Guelph and Toronto, arriving at 13:30 for a travel time of 5:30.  Or we can depart Waterloo at 09:00 for Hamilton, Niagara, and Toronto, arriving at 14:00.  Finally, we can depart Waterloo at 23:00 and arrive in Toronto at 07:05 the next morning, for a travel time of 8:05.</p>\r\n<p></p>','','','1\r\n7\r\n6 08:00 Windsor 1:55 London 1:35 Kitchener 0:55 Guelph 1:05 Toronto 4:50 Montreal\r\n2 08:00 Waterloo 0:45 Kitchener\r\n3 09:00 Waterloo 1:45 Hamilton 1:05 Niagara\r\n2 12:00 Niagara 2:00 Toronto\r\n2 07:00 Waterloo 1:45 Toronto\r\n2 23:00 Waterloo 0:55 Guelph\r\n2 06:00 Guelph 1:05 Toronto\r\nWaterloo Toronto\r\n','07:00 1:45\r\n08:00 5:30\r\n09:00 5:00\r\n23:00 8:05\r\n','0','','','','2015-04-18 22:01:26',1,128,'N',0,0,0,0,100.00,NULL,NULL,NULL,'hznu'),

	(1287,'Time Zones','<img align=\"right\" src=\"/JudgeOnline/admin/../upload/pimg1287_1.gif\" alt=\"\" />\n<p>Prior to the late nineteenth century, time keeping was a purely local phenomenon. Each town would set their clocks to noon when the sun reached its zenith each day. A clockmaker or town clock would be the &quot;official&quot; time and the citizens would set their pocket watches and clocks to the time of the town - enterprising citizens would offer their services as mobile clock setters, carrying a watch with the accurate time to adjust the clocks in customer\'s homes on a weekly basis. Travel between cities meant having to change one\'s pocket watch upon arrival.</p>\n<p>However, once railroads began to operate and move people rapidly across great distances, time became much more critical. In the early years of the railroads, the schedules were very confusing because each stop was based on a different local time.  The standardization of time was essential to efficient operation of railroads.</p>\n<p>In 1878, Canadian Sir Sanford Fleming proposed the system of worldwide time zones that we use today. He recommended that the world be divided into twenty-four time zones, each spaced 15 degrees of longitude apart. Since the earth rotates once every 24 hours and there are 360 degrees of longitude, each hour the earth rotates one-twenty-fourth of a circle or 15� of longitude. Sir Fleming\'s time zones were heralded as a brilliant solution to a chaotic problem worldwide.</p>\n<p>United States railroad companies began utilizing Fleming\'s standard time zones on November 18, 1883. In 1884 an International Prime Meridian Conference was held in Washington D.C. to standardize time and select the Prime Meridian. The conference selected the longitude of Greenwich, England as zero degrees longitude and established the 24 time zones based on the Prime Meridian. Although the time zones had been established, not all countries switched immediately. Though most U.S. states began to adhere to the Pacific, Mountain, Central, and Eastern time zones by 1895, Congress didn\'t make the use of these time zones mandatory until the Standard Time Act of 1918.</p>\n<p>Today, many countries operate on variations of the time zones proposed by Sir Fleming. All of China (which should span five time zones) uses a single time zone - eight hours ahead of Coordinated Universal Time (known by the abbreviation UTC - based on the time zone running through Greenwich at 0� longitude). Russia adheres to its designated time zones although the entire country is on permanent Daylight Saving Time and is an hour ahead of their actual zones. Australia uses three time zones - its central time zone is a half-hour ahead of its designated time zone. Several countries in the Middle East and South Asia also utilize half-hour time zones.</p>\n<p>Since time zones are based on segments of longitude and lines of longitude narrow at the poles, scientists working at the North and South Poles simply use UTC time. Otherwise, Antarctica would be divided into 24 very thin time zones!</p>\n<p>Time zones have recently been given standard capital-letter abbreviations as follows:</p>\n<pre>\nUTC Coordinated Universal Time\nGMT Greenwich Mean Time, defined as UTC\nBST British Summer Time, defined as UTC+1 hour\nIST Irish Summer Time, defined as UTC+1 hour\nWET Western Europe Time, defined as UTC\nWEST Western Europe Summer Time, defined as UTC+1 hour\nCET Central Europe Time, defined as UTC+1\nCEST Central Europe Summer Time, defined as UTC+2\nEET Eastern Europe Time, defined as UTC+2\nEEST Eastern Europe Summer Time, defined as UTC+3\nMSK Moscow Time, defined as UTC+3\nMSD Moscow Summer Time, defined as UTC+4\nAST Atlantic Standard Time, defined as UTC-4 hours\nADT Atlantic Daylight Time, defined as UTC-3 hours\nNST Newfoundland Standard Time, defined as UTC-3.5 hours\nNDT Newfoundland Daylight Time, defined as UTC-2.5 hours\nEST Eastern Standard Time, defined as UTC-5 hours\nEDT Eastern Daylight Saving Time, defined as UTC-4 hours\nCST Central Standard Time, defined as UTC-6 hours\nCDT Central Daylight Saving Time, defined as UTC-5 hours\nMST Mountain Standard Time, defined as UTC-7 hours\nMDT Mountain Daylight Saving Time, defined as UTC-6 hours\nPST Pacific Standard Time, defined as UTC-8 hours\nPDT Pacific Daylight Saving Time, defined as UTC-7 hours\nHST Hawaiian Standard Time, defined as UTC-10 hours\nAKST Alaska Standard Time, defined as UTC-9 hours\nAKDT Alaska Standard Daylight Saving Time, defined as UTC-8 hours\nAEST Australian Eastern Standard Time, defined as UTC+10 hours \nAEDT Australian Eastern Daylight Time, defined as UTC+11 hours \nACST Australian Central Standard Time, defined as UTC+9.5 hours \nACDT Australian Central Daylight Time, defined as UTC+10.5 hours \nAWST Australian Western Standard Time, defined as UTC+8 hours \n</pre>\n<p>Given the current time in one time zone, you are to compute what time it is in another time zone.

For example, the note called <i>middle C</i> corresponds to an  audio frequency of 263 Hz.  The octave below middle C spans the frequency range from 131.5 Hz to 263 Hz while the octave above middle C spans the range from 263 Hz to 526 Hz.</p>\n<p>An octave contains 13 <i>chromatic notes</i> whose frequencies differ by a common  ratio.  The separation between two adjacent  chromatic notes is called a <i>half-step</i> or <i>semi-tone</i>. Note that there are 12 semi-tones in an octave and therefore the frequency ratio represented by a semi-tone is 1.0593 (since 1.0593<sup>12</sup> = 2).  A <i>tone</i> is two semi-tones.</p>\n<p>While it might be convenient to use frequencies to describe musical notes, historical tradition demands that we name the notes of the chromatic scale, in order:  C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B, C, and so on, repeating the same names for each new octave.</p>\n<p>Western music rarely uses all the notes in the chromatic scale. Instead, 8 of the 13 chromatic notes are commonly used a composition. The most common such set of 8 notes is the <i>major scale</i>.   The 8 notes of a major scale, in order, are separated by:   <i>tone, tone, semi-tone, tone, tone, tone, semi-tone</i>.  A major scale can begin with any of the chromatic notes; this note defines the <i>key</i> of the scale. Coincidentally, in the key of C, the major scale consists of the notes: C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C.  On the other hand, in the key of F, the major scale is:  F, G, A, A#, C, D, E, F.</p>\n<p>There are other scales, notably the <i>minor scale</i>, and music composed in a particular scale sometimes uses notes that are not within the scale, caled <i>accidentals</i>.

Also, you must remain facing forward in order to see the screen.  This puts limitations on which feet you can use to hit which arrows.

	(1320,'Cat','<img align=\"right\" src=\"/JudgeOnline/admin/../upload/pimg1320_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p><p>In strong winds, sailboats tend to heel leeward (tilt away from the wind) like the one in the picture.  Heeling is undesirable for at least two reasons.  First, the effective sail area is reduced, as the effective height of the sail is multiplied by the cosine of the angle.  Reduced sail area implies reduced speed.  Second, the boat may heel to the point that its centre of gravity ceases to be above the hull, causing the boat to capsize.</p>\n<p>To mitigate these problems, catamarans like the one shown split the hull into two pieces (the port and starboard hulls).  This design increases the effective width of the boat.  Increased width decreases the vertical mechanical advantage of the sail, thus reducing heeling.  Increased width also increases the angle of heeling that can be tolerated before the boat capsizes.</p>\n<p>Heeling can also be mitigated by having the crew sit or stand on, or even hike out beyond, the windward hull.  If you look carefully at the picture you can see the two person crew hiking to windward.</p>\n<p>At some wind velocity, even these measures are insufficient to keep the boat upright.  A skipper\'s only choice (other than to capsize) is to let out the sail, which reduces its effective horizontal dimension much as heeling reduces its vertical dimension.  As with heeling, this action causes loss of speed.  If the boat heels sufficiently, it may not even be possible to let out the sail, as its outer corner may be obstructed by the surface of the water!</p>\n<p>Reefing is a mechanism for reducing the sail\'s area.  Roller reefing involves wrapping the sail around the boom (much like a window blind) so as to reduce its height.  With sufficient reefing, the heeling can be controlled in almost any wind.</p>\n<p>But reefing involves reduced speed, so our skipper has elected yet another approach.

With one exception (the center space is &quot;free&quot;) the spaces in the card are assigned values as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Each space in the \'B\' column contains a number from 1 - 15.</li>\n    <li>Each space in the \'I\' column contains a number from 16 - 30.</li>\n    <li>Each space in the \'N\' column contains a number from 31 - 45.</li>\n    <li>Each space in the \'G\' column contains a number from 46 - 60.</li>\n    <li>Each space in the \'O\' column contains a number from 61 - 75.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Furthermore, a number can appear only once on a single card.</p>\n<p>Here\'s a sample BINGO card:</p>\n<p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n    <tbody>\n        <tr align=\"center\">\n            <td><font size=\"5\">B</font></td>\n            <td><font size=\"5\">I</font></td>\n            <td><font size=\"5\">N</font></td>\n            <td><font size=\"5\">G</font></td>\n            <td><font size=\"5\">O</font></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr align=\"center\">\n            <td>10</td>\n            <td>17</td>\n            <td>39</td>\n            <td>49</td>\n            <td>64</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr align=\"center\">\n            <td>12</td>\n            <td>21</td>\n            <td>36</td>\n            <td>55</td>\n            <td>62</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr align=\"center\">\n            <td>14</td>\n            <td>25</td>\n            <td><font size=\"1\">FREE<br />\n            SPACE</font></td>\n            <td>52</td>\n            <td>70</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr align=\"center\">\n            <td>7</td>\n            <td>19</td>\n            <td>32</td>\n            <td>56</td>\n            <td>68</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr align=\"center\">\n            <td>5</td>\n            <td>24</td>\n            <td>34</td>\n            <td>54</td>\n            <td>71</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n</p>\n<p>The number of unique BINGO cards is very large and can be calculated with this equation:</p>\n<pre>\n// the B, I, G, and O columns * the N column\n(15 * 14 * 13 * 12 * 11) ^ 4 * (15 * 14 * 13 * 12)\n</pre>\n<p>While perhaps interesting to a statistician, the number of possible BINGO cards has nothing to do with player\'s</p>\n<a href=\"http://plg1.cs.uwaterloo.ca/%7Eacm00/050205/E.html#CHANCES\">chances of winning</a>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>You will note that there are 75 possible BINGO numbers:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre>\nB1, B2, B3, ... B15, I16, I17, I18, ... I30, N31, N32, ... O74, O75.\n</pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Each of these numbers is represented by a ball in a large rotating bin. Each ball is painted with its unique BINGO number. An announcer spins the bin, reaches in a selects a ball, and a announces it to the room. The players check all of their cards to see if that number appears on their card. If it is, they mark it.  A player may mark the centre FREE SPACE at any time.</p>\n<p>When a player has a BINGO (5 marks in a row, column, or diagonal), he or she calls out BINGO. The game pauses while the card is verified. If indeed a winner, the game stops and a new game begins. If the card wasn\'t a winner, the game proceeds where it left off. Each BINGO game proceeds until someone wins (there\'s always a winner).</p>\n<p>The first line of input contains <i>n</i>, the number of BINGO games that you will analyze.  <i>n</i> game descriptions follow.  Each game description specifies a card to be played followed by a sequence of BINGO numbers.  You are to determine, when the holder of the card will win the game, assuming the player has just this one card and there are no other players.</p>\n<p>Each card description consists of five lines, giving the numbers on the card row by row.  All but the 3rd row contain 5 numbers; the 3rd contains 4 because of the free space.  One or more lines follow that represent some ordering of all 75 bingo numbers.  All bingo numbers are simply integers between 1 and 75 - the one-letter prefix is redundant.  For each game, ouput the line &quot;BINGO after <i>n</i> numbers announced&quot; as appropriate. <a name=\"CHANCES\">\n<h4>Chances of Winning</h4>\n</a></p>\n<p>Every BINGO game has a winning card, so a player\'s chances of winning depend on the number of cards in the game and how many cards s/he is playing. For example, if a player has 12 cards in a game with 1200 cards,  the chances of winning for that player is 1 in 100.</p>','','','1\n10 17 39 49 64\n12 21 36 55 62\n14 25 52 70\n7 19 32 56 68\n5 24 34 54 71\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\n21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30\n31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40\n41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50\n51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60\n61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70\n71 72 73 74 75\n','BINGO after 14 numbers announced\n','0','','','','2014-12-26 22:14:33',1,128,'N',1,2,0,1,99.93,NULL,NULL,NULL,'hznu'),

Fortunately, he has left a 		bungee rope on a nearby highway bridge which he can use to escape from his 		enemies. His plan is to attach one end of the rope to the bridge, the other end of  		the rope to his body and jump off the 		bridge. At the moment he reaches the ground, he will cut the rope, jump 		into his car and be gone.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, he had not had enough time to calculate whether the bungee 		rope has the right length, so it is not clear at all what is going to 		happen when he jumps off the bridge. There are three possible scenarios:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li style=\"margin: 5px;\">The rope is too short 				(or too strong), and James Bond will 				never reach the ground.</li>\n    <li style=\"margin: 5px;\">The rope is too long 				(or too weak), and James Bond will be 				going too fast when he touches the 				ground. Even for a special agent, this 				can be very dangerous.  You may assume 				that if he collides at a speed of more 				than 10 m/s, he will not survive the 				impact.</li>\n    <li style=\"margin: 5px;\">The rope\'s length and 				strength are good.

Then the 				force with which the bungee rope pulls 				him back into the sky depends on the 				current length of the rope and is 				<blockquote> 					<i>k * &Delta;l</i>, 				</blockquote>  				where <i>&Delta;l</i> is the 				difference between the rope\'s current 				length and its nominal, unexpanded 				length, and <i>k</i> is a 				rope-specific constant.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given the rope\'s strength</p>\n<p><i>k</i></p>\n<p>, the nominal length 		of the rope</p>\n<p><i>l</i></p>\n<p>in meters, the height of the 		bridge</p>\n<p><i>s</i></p>\n<p>in meters, and James Bond\'s body 		weight</p>\n<p><i>w</i></p>\n<p>, you have to determine what is going 		to happen to our hero.

	(1370,'Humidex','<b>Adapted from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</b>\r\n<p>The humidex is a measurement used by Canadian meteorologists to reflect the combined effect of heat and humidity. It differs from the heat index used in the United States in using dew point rather than relative humidity.</p>\r\n<p>When the temperature is 30 C (86 F) and the dew point is 15 C (59 F), the humidex is 34 (note that humidex is a dimensionless number, but that the number indicates an approximate temperature in C). If the temperature remains 30 C and the dew point rises to 25 C (77 F), the humidex rises to 42.3.</p>\r\n<p>The humidex tends to be higher than the U.S. heat index at equal temperature and relative humidity.</p>\r\n<p>The current formula for determining the humidex was developed by J.M. Masterton and F.A. Richardson of Canada\'s Atmospheric Environment Service in 1979.</p>\r\n<p>According to the Meteorological Service of Canada, a humidex of at least 40 causes &quot;great discomfort&quot; and above 45 is &quot;dangerous.&quot; When the humidex hits 54, heat stroke is imminent.</p>\r\n<p>The record humidex in Canada occurred on June 20, 1953, when Windsor, Ontario hit 52.1. (The residents of Windsor would not have known this at the time, since the humidex had yet to be invented.) More recently, the humidex reached 50 on July 14, 1995 in both Windsor and Toronto.</p>\r\n<p>The humidex formula is as follows:</p>\r\n<pre>\r\n    humidex = temperature + h\r\n    h = (0.5555)*(e - 10.0)\r\n    e = 6.11 * exp [5417.7530 * ((1/273.16) - (1/(dewpoint+273.16)))]\r\n</pre>\r\n<p>where exp(x) is 2.718281828 raised to the exponent x.</p>\r\n<p>While humidex is just a number, radio announcers often announce it as if it were the temperature, e.g. &quot;It\'s 47 degrees out there ... [pause] .. with the humidex,&quot;. Sometimes weather reports give the temperature and dewpoint, or the temperature and humidex, but rarely do they report all three measurements. Write a program that, given any two of the measurements, will calculate the third.</p>\r\n<p>You may assume that for all inputs, the temperature, dewpoint, and humidex are all between -100 C and 100 C.</p>','<p>Input will consist of a number of lines.

Luckily for him, the PM has decided to stimulate the economy by funding a new math building. To maximize the stimulating effect, the construction process is outsourced to a software engineering consultant who employs agile methodologies. The building will be built first, and designed later. The Dean has some concerns about this innovative process. After all, it would be very embarrassing if the walls of the new math building failed to line up at right angles!</p>\r\n<p>The Dean sneaks out one night with a tape measure to survey the last remaining grassy area on campus, where the new building will go. He drives stakes into the ground, then measures the distances between them. Afterwards, he retreats into his office to construct a map from his measurements. He notices that the first three stakes form a right-angled triangle with arms of length one metre and hypotenuse of length sqrt(2) metres. And that\'s not all. The Dean plots these first three stakes on a piece of graph paper at coordinates (0,0), (0,1), and (1,0). After plotting some of the other stakes, it turns out that all of the stakes happen to be precisely at lattice points (i.e. points with integer coordinates) on the graph paper.

An idea can even serve as the basis for creative people to derive even better ideas. Each person relies on a specific set of ideas to build on and create new ideas.</p>\r\n<p>In order to realize these benefits, ideas need to be communicated to the people who use them. People have developed an extensive worldwide communication network to satisfy this need. The network is composed of a series of tubes connecting people. The tubes are inhabited by curious creatures called packets which carry ideas from one person to another. In order to avoid collisions between packets, the tubes are all unidirectional. Each person can have zero or more incoming and zero or more outgoing tubes.</p>\r\n<p>All of the packets start at the same person, and each packet follows the following algorithm:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>Learn and remember the ideas created by the current person.</li>\r\n    <li>If there are no outgoing tubes from the current person, stop         executing the algorithm.</li>\r\n    <li>Otherwise, choose an arbitrary outgoing tube and use it to         travel to a new person.</li>\r\n    <li>Tell the new person all of the ideas that he or she needs from         other people.</li>\r\n    <li>Go back to step 1.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The input data is such that it is possible for a packet to reach every person from person 0, and whenever a person P relies on a given idea, every path a packet could have taken to reach P will have visited at least one person who created that idea. It is possible for more than one person to independently create the same idea.</p>\r\n<p>To ease the strain on each packet, you would like to minimize the number of ideas that it remembers at any given time by directing the packet to forget certain ideas in certain tubes. However, in so doing, you must ensure that no matter what path the packet takes, every time it visits a person, the packet knows all of the ideas that the person needs.</p>','<p>The first line of input contains a single integer, the number of test cases to follow. Each test case begins with a line containing three integers N, M, I, the number of people, tubes, and ideas, respectively. Each of these integers is between 1 and one thousand, inclusive. People are numbered from 0 to N-1, ideas from 0 to I-1. All of the packets start at person 0.  2N lines follow, two lines for each person in order from 0 to N-1. Each of these lines contains some number of integers separated by spaces. For each person, the first line lists the ideas that the person needs, and the second line lists the ideas that the person creates. A given idea will never appear on both lines for the same person.

That is, if the ant is on the flagstone with coordinates (x,y) at time t, she will be on one of the five flagstones with the following coordinates at time t+1: </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\">(x, y), (x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), (x, y-1). </span></span></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\">The ant cannot go out of the rectangular area. The ant can visit the same flagstone more than once. </span></span></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\">Insects are easy to starve. The ant has to go back to her nest without starving. Physical strength of the ant is expressed by the unit &quot;HP&quot;. Initially, the ant has the strength of 6 HP. Every second, she loses 1 HP. When the ant arrives at a flagstone with some food on it, she eats a small piece of the food there, and recovers her strength to the maximum value, i.e., 6 HP, without taking any time. The food is plenty enough, and she can eat it as many times as she wants. </span></span></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\">When the ant\'s strength gets down to 0 HP, she dies and will not move anymore. If the ant\'s strength gets down to 0 HP at the moment she moves to a flagstone, she does not effectively reach the flagstone: even if some food is on it, she cannot eat it; even if the hole is on that stone, she has to die at the entrance of her home. </span></span></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\">If there is a puddle on a flagstone, the ant cannot move there. </span></span></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\">Your job is to write a program which computes the minimum possible time for the ant to reach the hole with positive strength from her start position, if ever possible.</span></span></p>','<p><span style=\"font-size: medium\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\">The input consists of multiple maps, each representing the size and the arrangement of the rectangular area.

The integer dyx represents the state of the flagstone with coordinates (x, y) as follows. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\">0: There is a puddle on the flagstone, and the ant cannot move there. <br />\r\n1, 2: Nothing exists on the flagstone, and the ant can move there. `2\' indicates where the ant initially stands. <br />\r\n3: The hole to the nest is on the flagstone. <br />\r\n4: Some food is on the flagstone. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\">There is one and only one flagstone with a hole.

In the dictionary, each word takes a line, behind each word is its frequency, and these words are stored in the dictionary by lexicographic. At the time of segmenting word we find out all the words according to the dictionary, then find out all the possible cut paths(the word strings),and choose a best (that is, the biggest probability) path as the output, the key of this approach is to find out the best path efficiently.

	(1461,'Page Replacement','<p></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Page replacement algorithms were a hot topic of research and debate in the 1960s and 1970s. That mostly ended with the development of sophisticated LRU approximations and working set algorithms. Since then, some basic assumptions made by the traditional page replacement algorithms were invalidated, resulting in a revival of research. In particular, the following trends in the behavior of underlying hardware and user-level software has affected the performance of page replacement algorithms:</span></p>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Size of primary storage has increased by multiple orders of magnitude. With several gigabytes of primary memory, algorithms that require a periodic check of each and every memory frame are becoming less and less practical. Memory hierarchies have grown taller. The cost of a CPU cache miss is far more expensive. This exacerbates the previous problem.</span></p>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Locality of reference of user software has weakened. This is mostly attributed to the spread of object-oriented programming techniques that favor large numbers of small functions, use of sophisticated data structures like trees and hash tables that tend to result in chaotic memory reference patterns, and the advent of garbage collection that drastically changed memory access behavior of applications.</span></p>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Requirements for page replacement algorithms have changed due to differences in operating system kernel architectures. In particular, most modern OS kernels have unified virtual memory and file system caches, requiring the page replacement algorithm to select a page from among the pages of both user program virtual address spaces and cached files. The latter pages have specific properties. For example, they can be locked, or can have write ordering requirements imposed by journaling. Moreover, as the goal of page replacement is to minimize total time waiting for memory, it has to take into account memory requirements imposed by other kernel sub-systems that allocate memory. As a result, page replacement in modern kernels (Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris) tends to work at the level of a general purpose kernel memory allocator, rather than at the higher level of a virtual memory subsystem.</span></p>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">There are many page replacement algorithms, one of them is LRU:</span></p>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">The least recently used page (LRU) replacement algorithm, though similar in name to NRU(Not recently used), differs in the fact that LRU keeps track of page usage over a short period of time, while NRU just looks at the usage in the last clock interval. LRU works on the idea that pages that have been most heavily used in the past few instructions are most likely to be used heavily in the next few instructions too. While LRU can provide near-optimal performance in theory (almost as good as Adaptive Replacement Cache), it is rather expensive to implement in practice. There are a few implementation methods for this algorithm that try to reduce the cost yet keep as much of the performance as possible.</span></p>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">One important advantage of LRU algorithm is that it is amenable to full statistical analysis. It has been proved, for example, that LRU can never result in more than N-times more page faults than OPT algorithm, where N is proportional to the number of pages in the managed pool.</span></p>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">The most expensive method is the linked list method, which uses a linked list containing all the pages in memory. At the back of this list is the least recently used page, and at the front is the most recently used page. The cost of this implementation lies in the fact that items in the list will have to be moved about every memory reference, which is a very time-consuming process.</span></p>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Another method that requires hardware support is as follows: suppose the hardware has a 64-bit counter that is incremented at every instruction. Whenever a page is accessed, it gains a value equal to the counter at the time of page access. Whenever a page needs to be replaced, the operating system selects the page with the lowest counter and swaps it out. With present hardware, this is not feasible because the required hardware counters do not exist.</span></p>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">The LRU algorithm with 3 pages at most in the management pool runs as follows:</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\"><span style=\"font-family: Courier New\">7&nbsp; 0&nbsp; 1&nbsp; 2&nbsp; 0&nbsp; 3&nbsp; 0&nbsp; 4&nbsp; 2&nbsp; 3&nbsp; 0&nbsp; 3&nbsp; 2&nbsp; 1&nbsp; 2&nbsp; 0&nbsp; 1&nbsp; 7&nbsp; 0&nbsp; 1&nbsp; reference string<br />\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />\r\n7&nbsp; 7&nbsp; 7&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4&nbsp; 4&nbsp; 4&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp; 0&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp; 0&nbsp; 3&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; page frames in pool<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp; 2&nbsp; 2&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">12 page faults occurred.</span></p>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">For a given reference string, you need to calculate the number of page faults.</span></span></p>','<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">The first line contains an integer, the number of test cases.

	(1462,'RSA Signing','<p><span style=\"font-size: medium\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\">In cryptography, RSA is an algorithm for public-key cryptography. It was the first algorithm known to be suitable for signing as well as encryption, and one of the first great advances in public key cryptography. RSA is widely used in electronic commerce protocols, and is believed to be secure given sufficiently long keys and the use of up-to-date implementations.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\"><br />\r\nRSA involves a public key and a private key. The public key can be known to everyone and is used for encrypting messages. Messages encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted using the private key. The keys for the RSA algorithm are generated the following way:</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small\"><span style=\"font-family: Courier New\">&nbsp; 1. Choose two distinct large random prime numbers p and q<br />\r\n&nbsp; 2. Compute n = p * q<br />\r\n&nbsp; 3. Compute the totient: &phi;(n) = (p-1) * (q-1)<br />\r\n&nbsp; 4. Choose an integer e such that 1 &lt; e &lt; &phi;(n), and e and &phi;(n) share no factors other than 1<br />\r\n&nbsp; 5. Compute d to satisfy the congruence relation d * e &equiv; 1 mod (&phi;(n))</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\"><br />\r\nThe public key consists of the modulus n, and the public (or encryption) exponent e. The private key consists of the modulus n, and the private (or decryption) exponent d, which must be kept secret.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\"><br />\r\nEncrypting messages:<br />\r\nAlice transmits her public key (n,e), to Bob and keeps the private key secret. Bob then wishes to send message M to Alice. He first turns M into a number m &lt; n. Then computes the ciphertext c, corresponding to:</span></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-size: small\"><span style=\"font-family: Courier New\">c = m^e mod n</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\">This can be done quickly using the method of exponentiation by squaring. Bob then transmits c, to Alice.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\"><br />\r\nDecrypting messages:<br />\r\nAlice can recover m from c, by using her private key exponent d, by the following computation:</span></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-size: small\"><span style=\"font-family: Courier New\">m = c^d mod n</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\">Given m, she can recover the original message M.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\"><br />\r\nSuppose Alice uses Bob\'s public key to send him an encrypted message. In the message, she can claim to be Alice but Bob has no way of verifying that the message was actually from Alice since anyone can use Bob\'s public key to send him encrypted messages. So, in order to verify the origin of a message, RSA can also be used to sign a message. Suppose Alice wishes to send a signed message to Bob. She can use her own private key to do so. She produces a hash value of the message m, raises it to the power of d mod n (as she does when decrypting a message), and attaches it as a &quot;signature&quot; to the message. When Bob receives the signed message, he uses the same hash algorithm in conjunction with Alice\'s public key. He raises the signature to the power of e mod n (as he does when encrypting a message), and compares the resulting hash value with the message\'s actual hash value. If the two agree, he knows that the author of the message was in possession of Alice\'s secret key, and that the message has not been tampered with since.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\"><br />\r\nNow you got Alice\'s public key, and you want to pretend to be Alice in order to send a message to Bob, how can you fake her signature if her key is weak?<br />\r\n</span></span></p>','<p><span style=\"font-size: medium\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman\">The first line in the input is one integer T, indicates the number of test cases.

It is too simple that just say &ldquo;THX&rdquo; to express my sincere thank, but I must say &ldquo;Thank you &ldquo;for you all. I send my particular thank to Doctor Wu for you help and care to me and the whole ACM team. Huicpc3-15, my teammate at footmen, is the most important bosom friend in my life.

I really like if the seats in one classroom can be moved to another one, although it is impossible in our school now. In this case, we can move the superfluous seats in one classroom to another one. How wonderful the idea is! To make it easier, we just consider the classrooms in one floor. Suppose one floor is a rectangle and is divided into grids, and every grid is a classroom.

They also defined if all elements in a sequence are Qinghuai numbers, the sequence itself is said to be built with Qinghuai, and the number of Qinghuai numbers is called Qinghuai Factors. Moreover, after some research, people found that there is a feature called &ldquo;Buy Buy Buy Ring&rdquo; on Skyat, causing all reservation counts multiplied by a factor (possibly 1).

style=\"text-indent:21pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"> 	首先，yybird认为，对于同一类型的题目，每多刷一次，收获都会比上一次小。当次数达到一定程度的时，我们就没有再刷这类题目的必要了（因为收获太小了，得不偿失）。  </span></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-indent:21pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"> 	以上描述有点抽象，我们可以将其数学化：假设某一类型的题目第一次刷时收获为a。那么该类型的题目每多刷一次，收获会变为上一次的x倍（0&lt;x&lt;1）。举个例子，若x=0.6，第一次刷时收获为a=100，那么第二次刷时的收获为100*0.6=60，第三次再刷这种类型的题目，收获会变成60*0.6=36，以此类推。因此该类题目在刷了3次后，得到的总收获值为100+60+36=196。  </span></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-indent:21pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">

</span></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-indent:21pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"> 	举个例子，设a=100,b=80,x=0.6，那么可以计算得：  </span></span></p>\r\n<p

style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"> 	所以在得到了200的收获值后，就没有继续刷的必要了，由前面的计算知，刷三次的收获值S<sub>1</sub>=100+60+36=196&lt;200，但是刷四次的话S<sub>1</sub>=100+60+36+21.6=217.6&gt;200。因此该类题目刷四次最为合适。  </span></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-indent:21pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"> 	正当yybird要得意地公布他的研究成果时，做了大量重复试验的学弟曾小浪指出：实际上每次重复刷同类型题目的收获值并不完全是呈指数递减的，第n次刷该类题的收获值应该在原有的基础上乘以(n+1)/2。如果还是前面那个例子，那么前三次刷的收获值实际上应该分别为 (1+1)/2*100=100、(2+1)/2*60=90、(3+1)/2*36=72。小浪摸了摸下巴，进一步指出：该数列的前n项和S<sub>2</sub>同样会收敛于一个与x有关的数（即同S<sub>1</sub>一样有上限值）。  </span></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-indent:21pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:

</span><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">YiYi is a smart boy, he is fascinated in solving eccentric problems. One day when he was reading a book, he came across a very interesting problem. After a few time&rsquo;s thinking, he finally get the solution. YiYi considers this solution very heuristic, now he decides to show this problem to you so that you can also enjoy the happiness of solving this interesting problem. Here is the description of the problem:</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Suppose at first you have a sequence, S</span><sub><span lang=\"EN-US\">1</span></sub><span lang=\"EN-US\">, consists of two numbers: 1, 1. According to some rule you can get the sequence S</span><sub><span lang=\"EN-US\">n</span></sub><span lang=\"EN-US\"> from the sequence S</span><sub><span lang=\"EN-US\">n-1</span></sub><span lang=\"EN-US\">.Once you get S</span><sub><span lang=\"EN-US\">n-1</span></sub><span lang=\"EN-US\">, you will be asked to insert one n between a and b if a and b are two adjacent numbers in S</span><sub><span lang=\"EN-US\">n-1</span></sub><span lang=\"EN-US\"> and a + b = n. After you have inserted all possible n you finally get S</span><sub><span lang=\"EN-US\">n</span></sub><span lang=\"EN-US\">. You can also get the sequence S</span><sub><span lang=\"EN-US\">n+1</span></sub><span lang=\"EN-US\"> using the same method and so on.&nbsp; </span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">\r\n<p style=\"text-indent:21.0pt\" class=\"MsoNormal\"></p>\r\n</span><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">  </span><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">For example,S</span><sub><span lang=\"EN-US\">1</span></sub><span lang=\"EN-US\"> = 1,1.Since 1 + 1 = 2, we will insert 2 between two 1s and then we get S</span><sub><span lang=\"EN-US\">2</span></sub><span lang=\"EN-US\">, S</span><sub><span lang=\"EN-US\">2</span></sub><span lang=\"EN-US\"> = 1,2,1. Now we will insert two 3s in the sequence to get S</span><sub><span lang=\"EN-US\">3</span></sub><span lang=\"EN-US\">, as you can see, S</span><sub><span lang=\"EN-US\">3</span></sub><span lang=\"EN-US\"> = 1,3,2,3,1. In the same way, we know S</span><sub><span lang=\"EN-US\">4</span></sub><span lang=\"EN-US\"> = 1,4,3,2,3,4,1, S5 = 1,5,4,3,5,2,5,3,4,5,1 and so on. </span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Here the question comes: give you n, you will be asked to output the number of n in S</span><sub><span lang=\"EN-US\">n</span></sub><span lang=\"EN-US\">. For example if n = 5, you will output 4 since there are 4 5s in S</span><sub><span lang=\"EN-US\">5</span></sub><span lang=\"EN-US\">.</span></span></span></span></p>','<p><span style=\"font-size:

When we were young, we often looked up at the stars. How amazing they were! But, unfortunately, as we are becoming older and older, what used to be interesting can not interest us now. So what we can do is to find something more interesting!</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Here is one, maybe. Assume that all the stars are so far from us that we can treat them as points in a plane. You are given N stars in the plane, and a number K (0&le;K&le;N). What you need to do is to find the minimum square covering at least K stars, whose edges are all parallel to the axis. The stars which are on the edges of the square are also covered.</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p></p>','<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><!--[if gte mso

Each war breakout among cities, in a city there are more than one kind of unit. So the damage should distribute to each unit. The damage each unit bear is decided by the number of units in the proportion of total units count. For example, there are two kinds of unit: Footman and Archer.

Colours are denoted by the first 8 positive integers (see Figure 1). A sheet configuration is given by the sequence of colours obtained by reading the colours of the squares starting at the upper left corner and going in clockwise direction. For instance, the configuration of Figure 1 is given by the sequence (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8).

As a traditional elite\r\nuniversity in ACM/ICPC, there is no doubt that application forms will fill up\r\nthe mailbox. To constitute some powerful teams, coaches of the ACM/ICPC team\r\ndecided to use a system to score all applicants, the rules are described as\r\nbelow. Please note that the score of an applicant is measured by pts, which is\r\nshort for \"points\".\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">\r\n	1. Of course, the number of solved\r\nACM/ICPC problems of a applicant is important. Proudly,&nbsp;<i>Marjar\r\nUniversity</i>&nbsp;have a best online judge system called&nbsp;<i>Marjar\r\nOnline Judge System V2.0</i>, and in short, MOJ. All solved problems in MOJ of\r\na applicant will be scored under these rules:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:left;\">\r\n		(1) The problems in a set, called&nbsp;<i>MaoMao\r\n     Selection</i>, will be counted as 2.5 pts for a problem.\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:left;\">\r\n		(2) The problems from&nbsp;<i>Old Surgeon Contest</i>,\r\n     will be counted as 1.5 pts for a problem.\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin-left:36pt;\">\r\n	<b>There is no problem in&nbsp;<i>MaoMao Selection</i>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<i>Old\r\nSurgeon Contest</i>.</b> \r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:left;\">\r\n		(3) Besides the problem from&nbsp;<i>MaoMao Selection</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Old\r\n     Surgeon Contest</i>, if the problem\'s id is a prime, then it will be\r\n     counted as 1 pts.\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:left;\">\r\n		(4) If a solved problem doesn\'t meet above three\r\n     condition, then it will be counted as 0.3 pts.\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">\r\n	2. Competitions also show the strength of\r\nan applicant.&nbsp;<i>Marjar University</i>&nbsp;holds the ACM/ICPC competition\r\nof whole school once a year. To get some pts from the competition, an applicant\r\nshould fulfill rules as below:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:left;\">\r\n		The member of a team will be counted as 36 pts if\r\n     the team won first prize in the competition.\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:left;\">\r\n		The member of a team will be counted as 27 pts if\r\n     the team won second prize in the competition.\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:left;\">\r\n		The member of a team will be counted as 18 pts if\r\n     the team won third prize in the competition.\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:left;\">\r\n		Otherwise, 0 pts will be counted.\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">\r\n	3.

The registered member of<i>JapanJam</i>&nbsp;will have a rating after\r\neach contest held by it. Coaches thinks that the third highest rating in&nbsp;<i>JapanJam</i>&nbsp;of\r\nan applicant is good to show his/her ability, so the scoring formula is:\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center;\">\r\n	Pts = max(0, (r -\r\n1200) / 100) * 1.5\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">\r\n	Here&nbsp;<i>r</i>&nbsp;is the third\r\nhighest rating in&nbsp;<i>JapanJam</i>&nbsp;of an applicant.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">\r\n	4.

	(1896,'GOV Chronicles - Stupid Version','<p>\r\n	<span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">A chilly autumn night. Well wrapped up in a coat, a man is rapidly walking along a gray street. This is the Tradition Keeper of the ACM club in Ural State University. Drizzle and dull sky have always turned him nostalgic. And here we go again, the Tradition Keeper is bringing back the memories of distant past when Ural Federal University wasn\'t yet existing, and the story of Team.GOV was only starting. Indeed, this story deserves to be preserved for descendants. However, the details are slipping from the Keeper\'s mind and he seems to need an archive.</span> \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	4 Turgeneva st. The sixth floor, home Department of Mathematics and Mechanics where the Keeper himself has been studying a long time ago. Long corridors, narrow light bars on the floor, dark corners and eventually an office with ACM archive. The Keeper opened the door and found himself in a cramped room with numerous racks. Dozens of boxes and piles of paper are dumped near the walls. On one box three letters glittered with gold — GOV. The Keeper stepped to the box, drew a heavy file and opened it. On the first page in the right upper corner, there was a photo of a smiling young man with curly hair and a subscript: “Vadik Kantorov, the permanent captain of Team.GOV”.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Right after Vadik had entered University he played a few tricks and got into the half-ready team of Alex and Misha. Alex had been a bright programmer even he was a scholar and so troubled the ACM old-timers. Thus, Alex was ready to name the team: “Alarm”.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	So the Vadik\'s ACM-career began. The team existed during a year. The first battle was the Ural SU Championship where Alarm took only the fifth place and allayed the veterans\' fear. Next contest was the ACM ICPC subregional contest. The team played slightly better and took the seventh place out of all teams from the Ural region, and the third out of teams from Ural SU. Alarm became the third freshmen team in the Ural SU history to qualify for the regional contest in St. Petersburg. Unfortunately, in the regional contest, the team scored 86th and broke the record of the lowest position of Ural SU teams. It was a hard hit for the team. The choice had to be made: practice a lot, leave programming contests or keep performing poorly.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Putting back the decision, the team participated in the Ural Championship and scored 19th of all teams and 5th of Ural SU teams. That very moment it became clear that the line-up had to change. However, before the Ural Championship Alarm had applied to the Tatarstan Championship where the team\'s final battle took place. The team could not even solve a half of the offered problems and did not make in the best ten teams (11th place). On the way back on a train it was decided that Misha had to quit the team.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	In the new season, the team needed a new name. Here the preamble is completed and the story of Team.GOV commences. The team consisted of two members having little experience and even less success. A new name was defined — Team.GOV. After long considerations, Vadik figured out that the team missed a strong mathematician. Sasha who had been Vadik\'s high school friend was picked to fill this role. With Sasha\'s appearance, everyone felt that everything was going to run smoothly.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The time of Ural SU Championship came, the autumn of 2008, second university year. In unclear circumstances, Sasha has not come to the contest, but even in that case, Team.GOV was second best of Ural SU teams. One-year experience paid off! Sasha did come to the subregional contest but the team reached the only 14th place and did not qualify for the regional contest.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Luckily, Ural SU as the host of the subregional contests has a right to send one extra team to the regional contest. After long negotiations, Team.GOV could make it to the regional contest but with a sudden change in the line-up — Ivan B. came instead of Sasha. The replacement turned out to be fruitful — 76th place (+10 to Alarm\'s achievement).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	But what\'s said above is totally bullshit, the only thing you need to do is to divide the integer given in input by the number of the occurring times of letter \'e\' in the whole description and output the integer part of it. And in order to make it more difficult to find this paragraph, I put some extra text below, please ignore them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	After returning home Ivan B. found another team, thus Team.GOV had to fix the line-up again. Nikita was invited as the third player for the Ural Championship. On the qualification contest Vadik, Nikita, and Alex played very well: the team scored second of Ural SU teams. Truly an astounding success!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Being very enthusiastic Vadik and Nikita came to the Ural Championship. For some strange reason, Alex did not come. The team performed very poorly yet another time — 25th place of all teams and 5th of Ural SU teams. Nikita was not satisfied with such attitude and Team.GOV became only two players again — Alex and Vadik. What a curse! The team started to search for the third player.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	And the next season came — it\'s been two years since Vadik entered Ural SU. The search for the third teammate was completed successfully. Senior student Fedor was very experienced and had been practicing since 9th grade of high school. Bright future was ahead of the team. The curse was over and Team.GOV played three official contests with the same line-up. The team scored 12th in the subregional contest, safely advanced to the regional, and then took the third place on the Ural SU Championship.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The regional contest in St. Petersburg yielded a diploma and the 61st place, which was +15 to the previous year\'s position.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Having returned from St. Petersburg, Team.GOV participated in a unique competition of ACM ICPC veterans and current teams — Battle of Generations. Sadly, Alex couldn\'t come but team figured it out — Ivan K. came to the rescue and replaced Alex.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Alex wasn\'t keeping fit: no practice, light attitude to contests — Vadik began to look for a replacement. Nikita accepted the invitation cheerfully once he heard of Alex quitting the team. The first contest after his return to Team.GOV was a qualification for the Ural Championship. Suddenly Vadik had some urgent business in Europe, so Fedor and Nikita participated without him. They performed quite well and solved as many problems as the leaders did. As a result, the team got the third place and qualified for the Ural Championship.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The Ural Championship brought a new grief: 25th place out of all teams, and 4th out of Ural SU teams. Fedor and Nikita couldn\'t hold the nerves, and Vadik had to look for new teammates all over again.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The fourth and the last year of university. Vadik wanted to put an end to his ACM-career and he needed a new team. The veterans recommended taking young and promising Den. Vadik conducted a little test, and Den was taken. Only a few days were left before the Ural SU Championship, almost all the teams were formed, while Vadik was still answering his eternal question — where to get the third team member? Accidentally he found that Egor was looking for a new team after his previous team broke apart. A new line-up of Team.GOV was born.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	On the Ural SU Championship Team.GOV failed again and got an only 5th place. The subregional contest wasn\'t successful as well — 9th place out of all teams and 4th out of Ural SU teams. Ural SU got an extended quota and Team.GOV was going to St. Petersburg again.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Before St. Petersburg Team.GOV needed a serious practice session. All-Siberian Olympiad was a perfect shot. Team.GOV went to Novosibirsk and discovered again how weak they were: 39th place out of all teams and the worst performance out of Ural SU teams. So the guys set out to St. Petersburg with great leisure plans. Well, taking part counts no less than victory!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	On the regional contest, surprisingly for the coaches, Team.GOV scored five problems in the first four hours and was quite high ranked. After the contest, the coaches discovered that the team scored not only the sixth problem but also a seventh one. The result — 26th place (+35 to the last year\'s position) and a second grade diploma. Team.GOV finally reached success and glory. The road back home was ahead.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The spring, Team.GOV traditionally broke up. Vadik wanted to do something fancy, it was his last contest after all. Vadikinvites his Chinese girlfriend Xiaohong. The third invited teammate, unfortunately, didn\'t come, so in the last minute, Vadik took Vitaliy (medal winner of ACM ICPC World Finals) for the Game Tournament before the Ural Championship. Unfortunately, Vitaliy could not participate in the main contest, so Vadik took Sasha as an old friend. This was the last contest of Team.GOV.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The Tradition Keeper scratched his head: in how many Alarm / Team.GOV contests has every team member participated? Vadik had always told that Misha is the member number zero because he had played in Team.GOV before the team got its name. Vadik is indeed player number one.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	There\'s a tricky case with Vitaliy: of course, he hasn\'t taken part in any Team.GOV contest, Game Tournament shouldn\'t be counted. But he definitely deserves to be included in the history of Team.GOV, because he is an award winner of World Finals and a valuable player in general.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The Tradition Keeper meticulously listed all the members of Team.GOV. (Misha — 0, Vadik — 1, Alex — 2, Sasha — 3, Ivan B. — 4, Nikita — 5, Fedor — 6, Ivan K. — 7, Den — 8, Egor — 9, Xiaohong — 10, Vitaliy — 11). He counted that a number zero has played for 5 times (because exactly 5 contests were played by Alarm). And a number one participated in 20 contests.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<br />\r\n</p>','<p>\r\n	Firstly is a integer T(0&lt;T&lt;=500), then T lines follow.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Each line contains an integer n(0&lt;n&lt;10^9).\r\n</p>','Output the answer mentioned in the description.','1\r\n3','0','0','<p>\r\n	<span style=\"color:#E53333;\">Read it with inner peace.</span>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Life is a box of chocolate, you don‘t know what you are gonna get.&nbsp;\r\n</p>','WEI, Lixin','杭州师范大学第十届程序设计竞赛','2016-12-04 13:42:04',1,128,'N',127,384,92,122,85.30,NULL,NULL,NULL,'hznu'),

	(2257,'班尼特·胡迪的出生','<p>\r\n	有种现象叫薛定谔的滚。\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	当女朋友和你说“滚”的时候，这个“滚”是一1个“滚过来”和“滚远点”的叠加态。\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	当你在猜波函数（女朋友）到底想干什么的时候，波函数只是在静静地等待你求解（求姐）。而且你深知直接观测（张嘴问）一定会得到“滚远点”的通解。所以我们只能硬着头皮去解波函数。\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	那么怎么解波函数呢？\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	方法一：薛定谔的滚第一求解定律：波函数的解是一个通解加一个特解。\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	既然通解是“滚远点”，那么你大概率也会得到“给老娘滚的9再远点”的特解（注意这是一个公理，是不需要证明的），所以我们不能通过直接观测试出一个“滚远点”的特解。这样我们会百思不得骑姐。\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	方法二：从头计算法\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	波函数是多种一般函数的叠加，如果解出每个函数，那么将这几个特解线性叠加就会得到一个通解。\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	首先，第一个函数：周期函数。每隔一个月，总有那么一两天周期函数会波动一次（大姨妈）。我们要知道，在峰值的时候，周期函数对总体解的贡献较大，一般会解出来“滚远点”。而在半峰值（t/2）时，一般波函数会比较平缓，所以一般会解出来“滚过来”。这个函数不可导（不能问为什么），所以要额外注意。\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	其次，第二个函数：指数函数。当随着对女朋友认识的加深，好感也会加6深，而且这种加深随着时间变化是指数爆炸型的：一开始很慢，后来越来越快直到疯狂。这是有理论依据的：\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	如对指数函数求导：f（t）=e^t<br />\r\n为什么我随着时间的推移，我越来越爱你？<br />\r\n答：因为随着时间推移你越来越爱我啊！〔f\'（x）=e^t〕<br />\r\n可是为什么你回答我为什么我随着0时间的推移我越来越爱你的时候说因为我随着时间的推移我越来越爱你？<br />\r\n答：反正就是随着时间推移你越来越爱我。<br />\r\n〔f\'\'（x）=e^t〕\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	这句话好像和什么都没说一样，但是实际上什么都说了只是你没听懂。你看这个函数，得有多好的性质啊8！\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	因为“爱你”和“滚过来”是正相关，所以这个指数函数和滚过来有多大的相关性，大家心里都有谱。\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	当然不是每个波函数都这么单纯的，有的人很强势，她的波函数虽然构成简单，但是计算量太大；而有的人很细腻，她的计算量虽然不大，但是波函数构成太复杂。所以从头计算只适合简单体系。\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	方法三：迭代法\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	迭代法本质上就是：<br />\r\n瞎猜。<br />\r\n猜错了，继续往收敛的方向猜。\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	可是波函数不是你能随便猜的，而且猜也要按照基本法。你能瞎jb猜吗？不能。\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	当然有一些大师一猜就准，滚的位置恰到好处，然后在这个距离上微调，我很佩服；但是一般人不能这样，因为猜错了，波函数就崩塌了，你们就没的玩了。\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	所以我建议采用：微扰法。\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	在当前你的位置引入一个微小的扰动。比如滚过来一个Δx，这个时候如果波函数没有明显的变化，那就继续滚过来一个Δx……如此往复，直到一个微小的Δx就导致波函数巨大的变化：\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	你给我滚开1！\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	那你就滚n个-Δx。\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	然后继续滚过来一个Δx，这个时候如果波函数没有明显的变化，那就继续滚过来一个Δx……继续……\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	……\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	如此往复，几个回合之后，她必定会破涕为笑：\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	你干嘛啊你，你影帝啊你，蠢的要命，过来吧，我不生气了。\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	成功解出波函数。\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	综上所述，三种方式中，微扰法最佳，从头计算次之，紧扣定义要不得。\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	不过，首先你得有一个波函数（再见）<br />\r\n……………………<br />\r\n补充一个变分法：\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	这种方法其实我不是很喜欢，因为这种方法不吼。为什么呢？\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	变分法就是用不同的算符（用不同的问题）去求解（问）波函数，但是有的算符是一个好算符，有的并不是：\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	金钱算符：来，钱的事你不用操心。<br />\r\n暖男算符：是不是我哪里做的不对？<br />\r\n高冷算符：好，我觉得我们都需要冷静一下。\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	但是一般人算符都是：热水算符，\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	热水算符：你是不是哪里不舒服？多喝点热水就好了。\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	波函数：喝尼玛的热水，麻辣隔壁滚滚滚！（喏，滚三次，三重积分都出来了）\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	而且变分法有一个最大的缺陷就是，你永远只能无限地逼近真实的波函数而不能求解出波函数。而很多算符都是人为规定的，本质上是唯象的，不客观7的。\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	所以评论区有人说变分原理，我认为不适用。\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	当然了，你得先有一个波函数（再见）。\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<br />\r\n</p>','无','输出班尼特·胡迪的生日<span style=\"color:#262626;font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;font-size:15px;background-color:#FFFFFF;\">，答案按顺序分散在题干中<span style=\"color:#262626;font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;font-size:15px;background-color:#FFFFFF;\">(Description)</span>，均为阿拉伯数字，你需要在题干中找出所有的阿拉伯数字，按顺序拼接成答案，直接输出即可。<span>这个数字也是第1226564个素数，找不到可以换一种方法~</span></span>',NULL,NULL,'0','<span>文章作者：大黄鸭</span><br />\r\n<p>\r\n	链接：https://www.zhihu.com/question/29969687/answer/274816061\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<span>来源：知乎</span> \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	如果等下写不出题了可以回来看这题的段子。\r\n</p>','HU, Diheng','杭州师范大学第十一届程序设计竞赛','2017-12-23 23:46:49',1,256,'N',595,1250,0,NULL,100.00,'+1s','模','下个月枪毙名单出来了','hznu'),
